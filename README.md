# Flask Blog App

A personal project where I get to take my Python skills a notch higher by learning Flask. Some of the most important concepts learnt so far are:

1. Setting up a flask app -- The best practices
2. Setting up static CSS files in the `statics folder`
3. Setting up templates (HTML templates) which are particularly useful for DRY **Don't Repeat Yourself**
4. Form validation, and rendering forms on your web app. Also learnt how to log in a user and sign them up as well.
5. Use Bootstrap to style my web pages, and also display flash messages.
